# NumPy & Pandas Learning Repository

This repository contains structured Jupyter Notebooks created during my learning journey of NumPy and Pandas, two foundational Python libraries for numerical computing and data analysis. The notebooks include practical examples, explanations, and small projects focusing on data handling, cleaning, and visualization.

## Repository Structure

### NumPy
- **NUMPYClass.ipynb**  
  A comprehensive introduction to NumPy arrays, array operations, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and numerical computations.

### Pandas
- **pandasclass.ipynb**  
  Basic operations in pandas including Series, DataFrames, indexing, and data selection techniques.
- **pandas_dataframes.ipynb**  
  Deep dive into DataFrame manipulations, filtering, sorting, merging, and reshaping datasets.

### Data Cleaning
- **Handling missing data.ipynb**  
  Techniques for detecting and handling missing values using pandas functions like isnull(), fillna(), and dropna().
- **cleaning not null.ipynb**  
  Focused on identifying non-null values and cleaning specific parts of datasets.
- **missing data (data cleaning).ipynb**  
  A broader notebook on data cleaning techniques including handling nulls, type conversions, and basic imputation.

### Data Visualization
- **more visualization.ipynb**  
  Visualizing data using pandasâ€™ built-in plotting features along with some usage of matplotlib for better data insights.

## Features Covered

- Creating and manipulating arrays and dataframes  
- Handling missing and inconsistent data  
- Data filtering, merging, and reshaping  
- Visualizing datasets using simple graphs and plots  
- Best practices for data preprocessing
